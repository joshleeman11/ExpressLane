## How to use to this project

You should clone the repository and create a virtual environment in your terminal. On a Mac, use `python3 -m venv .venv`. `. .venv/bin/activate` use `pip install requirements.txt`. Then, you should create a new branch using `git checkout -b <new branch name>`, whatever you want to call it. This allows you to start making changes and committing them to the remote repo.
